"Accessory-Shield" 
This embedded systems project, developed using the STM32F411 microcontroller, explores the use of the Accessory Shield with various integrated peripherals. The project includes controlling a PWM buzzer, displaying 256×256×256 RGB LED colors, reading a 10K potentiometer, and interfacing with the ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer (±16g), LM75BDP temperature sensor (0.125°C resolution), and DS3231 real-time clock (RTC). The goal was to test and demonstrate each component's functionality individually using microcontroller-based code.
